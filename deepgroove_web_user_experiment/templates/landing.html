        <h2>Step 1: Welcome!</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                Welcome to the DeepDrummer experiment. The purpose of this
                experiment is to assess how effectively we can train a deep
                neural network, using limited data, to understand human musical
                preferences.
            </p>
            <p>
                The experiment will take place in two phases with a brief pause
                in between. During each phase, you will be asked to rate a
                number of short, automatically generated drum loops as either
                "good" or "bad".
            </p>
            <p>
                When we say "good" or "bad", we are asking you to judge whether
                the drum loop sounds musical or not. We are not asking you to
                make a judgment as to how original each drum beat sounds. If
                you could conceive of a drum beat being used in a real musical
                piece, you should rate it as "good". If the drum loop sounds
                unpleasant, annoying or has no musical quality in your view,
                then you should rate it as "bad".
            </p>
            <p>
                Each drum beat will be a short two-second loop repeated 4
                times, for a total of 8 seconds. This is because we find that
                repetition helps assess musicality. However, you do not have to
                listen to the full 8 seconds before rating a drum beat as good
                or bad. You can feel free to rate each drum beat as soon as you
                feel confident in your judgment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The experiment will take approximately 20 minutes of your time
                and should be completed in one go.  We greatly appreciate you
                taking the time to participate in this short study.
