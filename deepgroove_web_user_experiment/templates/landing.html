        <h1>DeepDrummer Experiment</h1>
        <h2>Step 1/1: Welcome!</h2>

        <div class="contents">
            <p>
                Welcome to the DeepDrummer experiment. The purpose of this
                experiment is to assess how effectively we can train a deep
                neural network, using limited data, to understand human musical
                preferences.
            </p>
            <p>
                The experiment will take place in two phases with a brief pause
                in between. During each phase, you will be asked to rate a
                number of short, automatically generated drum loops by clicking
                the "like" or "dislike" buttons.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the first phase, the ratings you provide will serve to
                train the system, and it will try to adjust what it is
                generating based on the preferences you express. Clicking the "like"
                button means you would like to guide the system towards
                generating more like the pattern you have just heard. Clicking
                "dislike" means you would like to guide the system away from
                the drum beat you have just heard. If a drum loop sounds
                unpleasant, annoying or has no musical quality in your view,
                then you should click "dislike".
            </p>
            <p>
                Each drum beat will be a short two-second loop repeated 4
                times, for a total of 8 seconds. We repeat the pattern 4 times
                because we find that repetition helps assess musicality.
                However, you do not have to
                listen to the full 8 seconds before rating a drum beat. You
                can feel free to rate each drum beat as soon as you
                feel confident in your judgment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The experiment will take approximately 20 minutes of your time
                and should be completed in one go.  We greatly appreciate you
                taking the time to participate in this short study.
